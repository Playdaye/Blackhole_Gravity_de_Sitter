## Sensitivity of BPS microstates by Sean Colin-Ellerin

A key signature of chaos in quantum chaotic systems is the random matrix behavior in the repulsion of energy levels. Since black holes are expected to be highly chaotic, their energy levels should exhibit such behavior. However, this cannot be true for BPS black holes as the energies of all of their microstates are fixed to be equal by the BPS bound. I will present a new diagnostic of chaos for BPS black holes, namely the sensitivity of their microstates to the couplings of the theory. This sensitivity can be detected by the mixing matrix for this degenerate subspace as one moves on moduli space, known as the Berry curvature. I will show that for fortuitous states in the $N=2$ supersymmetric SYK model and $N=2$ JT gravity, which are toy models for the black hole microstates, the Berry curvature has random matrix statistics. On the other hand, for the monotonous states dual to smooth, horizonless supergravity solutions, I will show in many different examples that the curvature is not chaotic at all.


## JT gravity on finite geometries: discretization, conformal gauge, quantization by Frank Ferrari

Extending the usual holographic framework to the case of finite bulk geometries ("finite cut-off") is an outstanding open problem that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. I will explain how the problem can be solved in the contect of JT quantum gravity, revealing many new interesting features and making an unexpected link with traditional Liouville quantum gravity techniques.


## BPS Black Holes in $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^3 \times S^1$ and Beyond by Matthew Heydeman

The Bekenstein–Hawking formula gives a coarse-grained count of black hole microstates, and it is remarkable that it can sometimes be reproduced from a microscopic count in string theory. However, recent progress shows that a more careful treatment of the gravitational path integral can significantly modify predictions of semi-classical gravity, even for supersymmetric black holes, producing situations where neither the supersymmetric index nor the Hawking area formula can correctly account for the degeneracies. Using the Schwarzian description in supergravity, we find that physically sensible black holes can preserve at most four supercharges, with an exceptional example in $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^3 \times S^1$. This notoriously poorly understood string background has nonlinear large $N=4$ superconformal symmetry, yet we make novel predictions for the BPS and near-BPS spectrum. Notably, we find discrete jumps in the BPS spectrum as a continuous parameter is varied, a quantum gravity effect with no known microscopic derivation. We corroborate this by constructing a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetric index yet possess temperature-dependent free energy, showing that the index, while protected, necessarily misses crucial information about the BPS spectrum.



## An introduction to quantum reference frames and applications in high-energy physics by Philipp Andres Hoehn

Quantum reference frames (QRFs) are a universal tool for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory. While they originated in the foundations of quantum theory and quantum information, they are particularly useful in theories with gauge symmetries, where they define a split between redundant and non-redundant information. In my talk, I will give an introduction to QRFs, explaining how they can be used to build gauge-invariant descriptions and give rise to a novel form of quantum covariance under changes of QRFs. This leads to a QRF-dependence of entanglement, thermal properties, and more generally of gauge-invariant definitions of subsystem partitions. For illustration, I will then apply this to perturbative quantum gravity and clarify how the recent story about “observers” in gravitational algebras by Witten et al. is one about QRFs. Time permitting, I will also apply this to entanglement entropy discussions in gauge theories.


## Secondary Invariants, trace relations and fermions by Robert de Mello Koch

We argue that the space of invariants of multi-matrix model quantum mechanics, at finite $N$, is generated by a set of invariants, naturally divided into two distinct classes: primary and secondary. The primary invariants act freely, while secondary invariants satisfy quadratic relations. We argue that the primary invariants correspond to perturbative degrees of freedom, whereas the secondary invariants emerge as non-trivial background structures. The number of primary invariants for a model with $d$ matrices is given by $1+(d-1)N^2$. The number of secondary invariants grows as $e^{cN^2}$ at large, with $c$ a constant. Finally, we identify a class of light single-trace operators that behave like free creation operators at low energy but saturate beyond a critical excitation level, ceasing to generate new states. This leads to a dramatic truncation of the high-energy spectrum of the emergent theory. The resulting number of independent degrees of freedom is far smaller than naïve semiclassical expectations, providing a concrete mechanism for how nonperturbative constraints shape the ultraviolet behaviour of emergent theories. Finally we argue that for bosonic vector models the set of bosonic secondary invariants are mapped, one-to-one, to the states of a fermionic bilinear color-singlet Hilbert space. We describe how the trace relations in the two descriptions are related.


## Aspects of fortuitous cohomologies in holographic field theories and matrix quantum mechanics by Eunwoo Lee

We investigate fortuitous cohomologies and how they behave as the coupling is varied in holographic field theories. Using S-duality, we study how these cohomologies appear at weak coupling and how they persist or reorganize at strong coupling. We then turn to the BMN matrix model, analyze its cohomologies, and examine spectral properties of the deconfined phase. Although black holes in the BMN matrix model have not been identified, our analysis suggests that, for fixed $N$, the area of a putative horizon is bounded from above.


## Polar states in AdS3 quantum gravity by Ji-Hoon Lee

TBA


## Perturbative Hilbert space of closed universe by Masamichi Miyaji

We construct Hilbert space of AdS and dS JT Lorentzian closed universes. By performing exact gravitational path-integral, we evaluate gauge-fixed matrix elements in cylinder geometry and identify physical Hilbert space and derive the gauge-fixed Wheeler de-Witt equation. The physical Hilbert space we identify takes the form of group averaging giving un-factorized resolution of identity. We discuss roles played by the path-integral measure, distinction between large/small diffeomorphism in matrix elements, choice of gauge fixing, and possible resolution for the discrepancy in WdW equations in the literatures. 


## Quantum Chaos and Fermionic 3D Gravity by Elisa Tabor

We introduce a theory of pure fermionic 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant. We compute the partition function with torus boundary for all possible spin structures. Combining modular invariance under different congruence subgroups with random matrix statistics, we construct Euclidean fermionic two-boundary wormholes, which are topologically a torus times an interval. These contain information about the spectral correlations between black hole microstates in the presence of fermions, and after analytic continuation to Lorentzian signature, they exhibit the expected late time ramp that is characteristic of random matrix universality. Finally, we generalize these wormholes to the case where the boundary CFT has various discrete symmetries. Based on upcoming work with Jan Boruch and G. Joaquin Turiaci.


## Superconformal indices in closed form and BPS spectroscopy by Sam Van Leuven

In the first part of this talk, I will present a method to evaluate superconformal indices of $4d$ $N=1$ superconformal field theories in closed form. To illustrate the use of such expressions, I will consider the example of $N=4$ $SU(2)$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) and evaluate indices in various BPS sectors. For the $1/4$  BPS Hall-Littlewood and $1/8$ BPS Macdonald index, the expressions manifest various features of the BPS spectrum at non-zero Yang-Mills coupling. In particular, the expressions suggest the absence of fortuitous or non-graviton operators in these sectors, which have recently been proposed as dual operators to supersymmetric black hole microstates in $AdS_5$.

In the second part of the talk, I will focus on the so-called BMN subsector of $N=4$ $SU(N)$ SYM for small values of N. By projecting onto states with equal $R$-charges, $R1=R2=R3$, it is possible to derive a closed form expression for the index over just the fortuitous part of the spectrum. The expression reveals various interesting features of the spectrum and offers insight into the form of explicit cohomology representatives.


## A random ensemble of BCFTs by Diandian Wang

Recent literature demonstrates that 3D gravity is dual to a random ensemble of 2D CFTs. This includes ensemble averaging over both OPE coefficients and spectra. In this talk, I will discuss a generalization of the story to an ensemble of CFTs with borders (BCFTs). Regarding OPE statistics, the bulk theory is an open-closed extension of Virasoro TQFT, which becomes 3D gravity with end-of-the-world branes in the classical limit. As for spectral averaging, we show that 3D gravity on a certain set of off-shell manifolds is precisely dual to a random matrix model describing the spectral correlations of the open-string sector of the BCFT. 


## Cusps in 3d gravity by Cynthia Yan

Three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds have accumulation points in the spectrum of their volumes, leading to a divergence in the sum over topologies. The limit points are cusped hyperbolic manifolds, and we propose to renormalize the sum by including the cusped manifold as a counterterm. This gives a reinterpretation of the zeta-function regularization procedure used by Maloney and Witten in the sum over $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ black holes. For pure $N=1$ supergravity, cusps with even spin structure can be used in a similar way. Cusps with odd spin structure are not needed to cancel any divergence, but they find an application by making the index nonzero.



## A review of Virasoro TQFT and some new understandings by Mengyang Zhang

In the first part of this talk, I will review the construction of Virasoro TQFT from the Chern–Simons formulation of pure $AdS_3$ gravity and its application to the statistics of two-dimensional holographic CFT data. I will then discuss the extension to three-dimensional de Sitter gravity and its relation to the double-scaled SYK model. In the second part, I will address the issue of topological invariance in Virasoro TQFT. Despite being “topological,” its partition function is not well-defined on arbitrary three-manifolds, distinguishing it from conventional Reshetikhin–Turaev–Witten TQFTs. I will explain how far the standard proofs of topological invariance can be generalized and comment on possible extensions beyond hyperbolic manifolds.


## The Bootstrap Method in matrix theories by Zechuan Zheng

The bootstrap method offers a powerful framework for solving theoretical models by systematically solving the optimization problem from the constraints imposed by kinematic and dynamic equalities and inequalities. This approach has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in tackling matrix models, especially in the large $N$ limit and in scenarios complicated by sign problems. In this presentation, we review the application of the bootstrap method across diverse models, with a particular emphasis on its implementation in the BFSS model, highlighting its potential to address longstanding challenges in this context.
